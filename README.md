# Pokemon Palettes

A color theory game using Pokemon sprites. Users will have a limited amount of time to identify the color palette type of a given Pokemon. The faster you can name that palette, the more points you will get!

This project is currently ongoing. Below is a mock up of what the game screen might look like.

There will be two types of users, people who play the game and admins to make sure the data is correct. Their respective user flows are as follows:
